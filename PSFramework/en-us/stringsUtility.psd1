Be aware that this package contains a lot of information including your input history in the console.
Please make sure no sensitive data (such as passwords) can be caught this way.

Ideally start a new console, perform the minimal steps required to reproduce the issue, then run this command.
This will make it easier for us to troubleshoot and you won't be sending us the keys to your castle.
